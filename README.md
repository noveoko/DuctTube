## Technical Details

YouTubeFocus works by modifying the YouTube interface in real-time using JavaScript. It:

1. Injects CSS to hide unwanted elements
2. Uses MutationObservers to detect and process dynamic content
3. Transforms video titles and thumbnails
4. Categorizes videos using pattern matching or AI (with Ollama)
5. Tracks watch time using browser storage

### AI Integration (Optional)

For enhanced title de-clickbaiting, YouTubeFocus can connect to a local Ollama instance:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Run a supported model (default: llama3:8b)
3. Configure the Ollama endpoint in extension settings
4. Enable Ollama integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Content not being filtered**: Try refreshing the page or disabling and re-enabling the extension
- **Menu not appearing**: Make sure you're on youtube.com and that no other extensions are conflicting
- **Ollama integration not working**: Check that Ollama is running and accessible at the configured endpoint

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in the extension settings to view detailed logs in the browser console. This can help identify issues with content filtering or Ollama integration.
